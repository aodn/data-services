abstract = The data is gathered using the Directional Waverider system developed by the Dutch company, Datawell. The Directional Waverider buoy utilises a heave-pitch-roll sensor, two fixed X and Y accelerometers and a three axis fluxgate compass to measure both vertical and horizontal motion. An on-board processor converts the buoy motion to three orthogonal (vertical, north-south, east-west) translation signals that are transmitted to the shore station. The directional spectrum is also routinely transmitted to the receiving station for further processing. The wave data is stored on the receiving station PC before routine transfer to Manly Hydraulics Laboratory via email.
