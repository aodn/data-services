abstract                 = DOT wave data is collected using Datawell wave rider buoys. Older wave data was collected using non-directional wave rider buoys. As technology advanced and directional measuring capabilities were developed in wave buoys, the DOT wave buoy network was gradually upgraded to directional wave rider buoys. Older datasets do not have directional information whereas newer datasets have directional information.
acknowledgement          = These data were collected and Quality controlled by the Department of Transport (DoT), Western Australian Government. These data were made freely available by the AODN - a data facility of the Integrated Marine Observing System [IMOS]. IMOS is supported by the Australian Government.
