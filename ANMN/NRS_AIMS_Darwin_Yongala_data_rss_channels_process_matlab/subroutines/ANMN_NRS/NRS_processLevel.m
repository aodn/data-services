function NRS_processLevel(levelQC)
% NRS needs an http access to download the xml RSS feed
% for the NRS data. This function needs as well writting access to the
% folder 'dataWIP' in which everything is stored.
% The RSS feed is sustain enough to automate fully the download of data
% from AIMS server to IMOS data server even with new channels, platforms or
% sites.test
%
% The date in the RSS feed is in local time, but the downloaded netcdf file
% is in UTC
% This function has to be run once a day. It checks the last date available of
% data to download for each channel, downloads the new NetCDF file(s) to the
% folder 'dataWIP'/NEW_Downloads/, then move them into
% 'dataWIP'/sorted/ . The last downloaded date for each
% channel is stored in the file 'dataWIP'/PreviousDownload.mat
% For each month, if one more day of data is available, all the data since
% the 1st of the current month is downloaded, and the previous file is
% automaticaly deteled from 'dataWIP'/Sorted ... but not from
% the opendap server. This is why a text file called
% 'dataWIP'/file2delete.txt is created. On each line is written
% the last file to delete on opendap.
%
% example : One\ Tree\ Island/Sensor\ Pole1/temperature/Water\
% Temperature@0.0m\ -channel_2/2010/level0_id2_2010-10-01T00-00-00Z_until_2010-10-08T09-42-37Z.nc
%
% Once a script or the user has deleted the NetCDF file(s), file2delete.txt can be
% deleted as well.
%
% This function calls finally create_DB_NRS, which writes 3 psql scripts in
% 'dataWIP'to load into pgadmin, or psql (psql -h DatabaseServer
% -U user -W password -d maplayers -p port < file.sql ) in the following order :
%   1.DB_TABLE_sites.sql
%   2.DB_TABLE_platforms.sql
%   3.DB_TABLE_parameters.sql
%
% All three tables should be loaded at each run of this script into the
% Database after having previously dropped the old ones in reverse order
% (because of foreign keys).
%
% Inputs:
%   XML                     - https address of the RSS feed
%   dataWIP   - Folder where data will be daily downloaded
%   dataOpendapRsync        - Main Data Storage Folder
%
% Outputs in 'dataWIP'/ :
%   DB_TABLE_sites.sql         - PSQL scripts for all different sites
%   DB_TABLE_platforms         - PSQL scripts for all different platforms
%   DB_TABLE_parameters.sql    - PSQL scripts for all different parameters
%   file2delete.txt            - Text file which fives the file location to
%                                delete on opendap ( or a remote folder
%                                which is not synchronised)
%   PreviousDownload.mat       - Matlab matrix in which the last downloaded
%                                date of each channel is stored. if the
%                                date doesn't exist, the script will
%                                download all the data since the launching
%                                date of the channel.
%   /sorted/...                - NetCDF files sorted by
%                               site/platform/parameter/sensor_depth/year
