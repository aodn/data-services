"abstract": "Aggregated Time-series Product: This file contains all measurements of the selected variable from all instruments deployed at the selected site. Timestamps are chronologically ordered, but may not be at uniform intervals. Instrument details are stored as a variable in order to keep a record of the origin of each measurement. The quality control flags of the variable of interest and DEPTH are preserved. Out-of-water measurements have been excluded, but no other filtering has been applied to the input data.",
