# ARGO Profiles JSON Generator for the Ocean Current website

This script processes directories containing `.gif` files and generates a `profiles.json` file per argo platform directory with metadata extracted from the filenames. The filenames follow a specific pattern, and the extracted information includes the date, profile number, and cycle number.

## Directory Structure

The script expects a directory structure as follows:

/mnt/oceancurrent/website/profiles/
├── platform_code1/
│ ├── YYYYMMDD_profileNumber_cycleNumber.gif
│ ├── YYYYMMDD_profileNumber_cycleNumber.html
│ └── ...
├── platform_code2/
│ ├── YYYYMMDD_profileNumber_cycleNumber.gif
│ ├── YYYYMMDD_profileNumber_cycleNumber.html
│ └── ...
└── ...


Where:
- `YYYYMMDD` is the date.
- `profileNumber` is the profile number.
- `cycleNumber` is the cycle number.

## Script Overview

The script performs the following steps:
1. Lists all platform codes in the specified `PROFILES_PATH` directory.
2. For each platform code, lists all files in the corresponding directory.
3. Filters the filenames to include only `.gif` files.
4. Extracts the date, profile number, and cycle number from each filename using a regular expression.
5. Creates a `profiles.json` file per directory containing the extracted information.

## Usage

### Running the Script

1. Confirm the `PROFILES_PATH` variable in the script to point to the base directory containing the platform code directories.
2. Run the script using Python as a cronjob:

```bash
python3 argo_oceancurrent.py
```

## Unittesting
Run the unittests with ```pytest```

# File Server API for JSON Generator for the Ocean Current website
Script `oceancurrent_file_server_api.py` is used for scanning `.gif` files in the Ocean Current file server for selected subproducts and products. JSON files are generated as per subproducts. The JSON file format is designed as below:
```JSON
[
    {
        "path": "/SST_4hr/SST/Adelaide", # /{product folder}/{subproduct folder}/{region}
        "productId": "fourHourSst-sst", # subproduct ID which align with Ocean Current front-end https://github.com/aodn/ocean-current-frontend/blob/main/src/constants/product.ts
        "region": "Adelaide", # region folder
        "depth": null, # this is used for some products which contains depth attribute
        "files": [
            {
                "name": "2024041918.gif" # scanned gif file existed in the file path "/SST_4hr/SST/Adelaide"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "path": "/SST_4hr/SST/SAgulfs",
        "productId": "fourHourSst-sst",
        "region": "SAgulfs",
        "depth": null,
        "files": [
            {
                "name": "2024051010.gif"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

**A selected product** is a product which has been implemented on Ocean Current website. Similarly, **a selected subproduct** is a subproduct which has been implemented on Ocean Current website. To scan the `.gif` files under particular product folders, `FILE_PATH_CONFIG` should be a dictionary in which has the file path configurations.
# TODO


The scanning logic is defined as follows:
1. In `FILE_PATH_CONFIG`, the product should be properly configured that align with its pattern in the ocean current file server.
2.
